ANDRUP: A Web Application for Automated Normal Distribution Ranking Using Python

Many data administrators, such as school registrars, teachers, company employees, and others, encounter errors and speed problems when analyzing data using Normal Distribution. Also, an enormous amount of data increases the difficulty faced when computing. These scenarios led them to misconceptions and irrelevant conclusions. There are existing statistical applications such as Microsoft Excel Pro, Gnumeric, WPS Office Spreadsheet, and others for aiding users in analyzing data through normal distribution. However, those applications do not show how those computed answers got and how to understand data with a graph â€” not to mention that some features of those applications require payment.

This web application can automatedly compute for mean, variance, standard deviation, and a percentile rank of a specified data point by the user with a graph. This study aims to lessen the time and difficulties faced by individuals analyzing their data through normal distribution. The web application will be free and easily accessed by everyone through various devices as long as it is connected to the internet.
